            <img src="images/Roker_North_pier_lighthouse._-_geograph.org.uk_-_496521.jpg" alt="Roker Lighthouse" class="sight">
            <div class="sight2"><p><strong>The lighthouse</strong> at the pier head was completed in 1903. Its distinctive stripes are of naturally coloured red and white Aberdeen granite. When built it was said to be Britain's most powerful port lighthouse. It was lit by a Chance Brothers incandescent petroleum vapour mantle lamp set within a third-order rotating catadioptric optic (consisting of a single-panel Fresnel lens backed by a prismatic mirror); it displayed a single flash every five seconds. In 1972 the light was automated and a set of sealed beam units replaced the old optic; these were themselves replaced with a dual-drive Pelangi PRL400 rotating pedestal and lamp in 2007.</p></div>
            
            <img src="images/NorthernSpire2018.jpg" alt="Northern Spire Bridge" class="sight">
            <div class="sight2"><p><strong>Northern Spire Bridge. </strong>The bridge has been constructed to the west side of the city over the River Wear, with the purpose of reducing traffic congestion. It was designed by Spence Associates in partnership with structural engineering firm Techniker. The bridge was first designed in 2005, but it was kept confidential for several years by the City Council to avoid a rise in expectations until funding was secured. The council was also considering plans for a cheaper, basic beam bridge design. The cost of the Spence design was estimated at £133 million for the bridge and the associated approaches and roadworks.</p></div>

            <img src="images/KeelSquare2015.jpg" alt="Keel Square" class="sight">
            <div class="sight2"><p><strong>Keel Square</strong> is a public space and boulevard based in Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, completed in 2015. Located to the north of the City Centre opposite the Vaux Site, the square was constructed as part of the larger St. Mary's Way redevelopment. A celebration of Sunderland's maritime and industrial heritage, the square's name was decided by the city's residents.</p></div>

            <img src="images/Stadium_of_light_Haway_the_lads.jpg" alt="Stadium Of Lights" class="sight">
            <div class="sight2"><p><strong>The Stadium of Light</strong> is an all-seater football stadium in Sunderland, England and the eighth and current home to Sunderland A.F.C. With space for 49,000 spectators, the Stadium of Light is the ninth largest stadium in England. The stadium primarily hosts Sunderland A.F.C. home matches. The stadium was named by chairman Bob Murray to reflect the coal mining heritage of the North East and the former Monkwearmouth Colliery site on which it stands. A Davy lamp monument stands at the entrance to reflect the coal mining industry that brought prosperity to the town.</p></div>

            <img src="images/Wearmouth_bridge.jpg" alt="Wearmouth Bridge" class="sight">
            <div class="sight2"><p><strong>Wearmouth Bridge</strong> is a through arch bridge across the River Wear in Sunderland. It is the final bridge over the river before its mouth with the North Sea. The original Wearmouth Bridge was designed by Thomas Paine and opened in 1796. In 1805 the bridge was repaired, and between 1857-1859 it was reconstructed by Robert Stephenson.</p></div>

            <img src="images/StPetersChurchMonkwearmouth.jpg" alt="St. Peter's Church" class="sight">
            <div class="sight2"><p><strong>Peter's Church,</strong> Monkwearmouth is the parish church of Monkwearmouth in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. It is one of three churches in the Parish of Monkwearmouth. The others are All Saints' Church, Monkwearmouth and St Andrew's Church, Roker. St Peter's was founded in AD 674–5 as one of the two churches of the Benedictine double monastery of Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey. The other church is St Paul's, Jarrow. The church is a Grade I listed building and part of a scheduled monument.</p></div>

            <img src="images/St_peters_campus.jpg" alt="St. Peter's Campus" class="sight">
            <div class="sight2"><p><strong>St Peter's</strong> is the home of The Sir Tom Cowie Campus at the University of Sunderland on the north bank of the River Wear. It is named after the adjacent St Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth. It is also the name of the Tyne and Wear Metro Station nearest to the campus, which is next to Wearmouth Bridge. The campus is adjacent to some of the pieces of the St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project. Pathways of Knowledge, a pile of books located outside of the University's library, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993. They are a reference to Bede and the Great Library of St Peter's.</p></div>
